        Two households, both alike in dignity,
        <br>
        In fair Verona, where we lay our scene.
        <br>
        From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,
        <br>
        Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean,
        <br>
        From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
        <br>
        A pair of stai-cioss'd loveis take theii life;
        <br>
        Whose misadventured piteous overthrows
        <br>
        Do with their death bury their parentsâ€™ strife.
        <br>
        The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,
        <br>
        And the continuance of their parents' rage,
        <br>
        Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,
        <br>
        Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;
        <br>
        The which if you with patient ears attend.
        <br>
        What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.
